Iâ€™m an economist currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at www.otto.de -- one of the Europe's largest e-commerce shop after Amazon. My main job is to develop forecasting models in the retail and logistics field, respectively.

I love the idea of open-source, and try to contribute to that idea. I have written or co-authored quite a number of packages for the open-source statistics and econometrics library named [Gretl](http://gretl.sourceforge.net/).

[Here](https://github.com/atecon/) is an overview about my Gretl packages.

Additionally, I am an official package reviewer for Gretl. Apart from that, I have co-founded the Gretl Association and currently I act as the vice-chairman of it ;-)

In my daily business, I also program with Python. In the past I have used Matlab and R, too.

Until 2018 I worked as post-doctorate researcher at the University of Hamburg in the socio-economics faculty and the economics department. I still do academic research which you can follow [here](https://ideas.repec.org/f/pta322.html). I am currently working on empirical network models in the finance area, on non-linear cointegration in the time-series analysis domain as well as on forecasting issues using machine-learning techniques.

On this page you will find blog posts, and some stuff about the projects I work on.
