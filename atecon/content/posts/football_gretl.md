Recently I stumbled over Julius Krumbiegel's nice little data analysis exercise entitled ["Analyzing international football results with Julia"](https://jkrumbiegel.com/pages/2021-06-20-football-data-analysis/). As the title already says, he's using Julia for this task.

The dataset used is cool, and I thought that this may be a cool exercise to show how to replicate Julius' results using my favourite data tool named [*gretl* -- an open-source statistics and econometrics cross-platform software](http://gretl.sourceforge.net/).
