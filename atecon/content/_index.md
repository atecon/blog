Hi, I' am Artur!

Iâ€™m an economist currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at www.otto.de -- Europe's 2nd largest e-commerce shop after Amazon.

The idea of open-source is jus great! I try to contribute to that idea by (co-)authoring a number of packages -- especially for the open-source statistics and econometrics library named [Gretl](http://gretl.sourceforge.net/).

Actually, I also volunteer as a Gretl package reviewer and I am a co-founder and deputy chairman of the [Gretl Association](https://gretl-assoc.github.io).

On this page you will find blog posts, and some stuff about the projects I work on.
